# Hi, I'm Yash 👋  
**AI Engineer · LLM Systems · Multimodal ML · Applied Deep Learning**

I build end-to-end AI systems — from model training to scalable backend deployment — with a focus on LLMs, recommender systems, reinforcement learning, and multimodal learning. My work sits at the intersection of research-grade modeling and production-grade engineering.

### 🚀 What I Work On
- **LLM Systems & RAG** — retrieval pipelines, evaluation metrics, prompt optimization, content generation, design-to-code systems  
- **Recommender Systems** — sequential recommenders (SASRec), continual learning, RLHF-optimized ranking  
- **Multimodal AI** — talking-head generation, diffusion for missing-modality restoration, multimodal trait prediction  
- **Computer Vision** — avatars, facial landmark models, gesture/behavior analysis  
- **MLOps & Backend Engineering** — FastAPI, Docker, vector DBs, scalable inference

### 🔬 Notable Projects
- **ReMoDiff** – Diffusion-based restoration of missing modalities (audio/video/text), improving Big Five prediction by 7%  
- **LLM-Enhanced Recommenders (RLHF + DPO + LoRA)** – Boosted NDCG/Precision/Recall by 170–200% on MovieLens-1M  
- **Sequential Recommenders with Continual Learning** – Added EWC + replay to SASRec, improving recall by 20%  
- **Talking Head Video Generation** – Transformer-GAN pipeline; co-authored a survey accepted at ICICT 2022  
- **AI Campaign Manager (Production)** – LLM-powered system reducing manual setup by 25% for 10+ enterprise clients  
- **Design-to-Code Generator** – Converts text concepts into production HTML/CSS templates

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, HuggingFace, Diffusers  
**LLM Systems:** LangChain, RAG pipelines, vector search, OpenAI / Llama  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker  
**Tooling:** Git, CI/CD, A/B testing, MLOps workflows

### 📈 Current Focus
- Building **agentic LLM systems with memory + tools**  
- Exploring **privacy-preserving federated RL**  
- Advancing **multimodal fusion** for behavioral understanding
